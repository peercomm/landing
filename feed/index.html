										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A very important question that comes to the mind of any building owner: what if an emergency occurs in your building? How can you make sure that the people inside are able to communicate with emergency responders outside? Are occupants able to dial 911 from their cell phones? What if there is an urgent need to evacuate the building? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These questions are made all the more urgent by the fact that many buildings are made of materials that can impede </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cellular or communication signals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how do you make sure that your building is safe for its occupants? How do you guarantee that first responders can communicate with building occupants seamlessly and efficiently?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is simple: you</span><a href="https://www.peercom.orgservices/errcs/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">get a certified &amp; professional company to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">install an ERRCS</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in your building</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3>What are ERRCS, in a nutshell?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emergency Responder Radio Communications System, or ERRCS</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is</span><a href="https://www.peercom.orgfirst-responder-communication-errcs-system/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an important </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">radio transmission</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tool that ensures reliable two-way communication for first responders within building structures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in-building communication system</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed to improve critical communications within a building as well as allowing flawless communication with the outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing the importance of this, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ERRCS systems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are mandated by the NFPA and local Authority Having Jurisdictions (AHJs). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most buildings that meet a specific size and occupancy threshold, which varies from city to city, must have an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ERRCS system</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> installed and be subjected to</span><a href="https://www.peercom.orgerrcs-recertification-and-annual-testing/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Annual Testing and Recertification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (ATR).</span></p>
<h3>But how do ERRCS work, exactly?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ERRCS</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uses a donor antenna to receive the radio signals from the local first responder network – signals that operate on private frequencies used by first responders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These signals are then re-amplified within the building at the required locations to make sure there are no blind spots when it comes to connectivity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ERRCS systems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> use communication tools compatible with existing public safety radio frequencies to ensure that first responders, paramedical professionals, and public safety personnel are able to communicate safely and efficiently, without being limited or restricted by signal existence or strength.</span></p>
<h3>What do ERRCS guarantee?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Installing an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ERRCS system</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides a safer world for us all. Its presence in the building is a safeguard against catastrophes happening because of lack of radio signals or proper connectivity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It helps first responders to manage any dangerous situation, from manmade disasters such as a raging fire or an explosion, to natural disasters like flash floods or typhoons. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ERRCS</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ensure the safety of both the people in danger and the people trying to help them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, it is vital to have a knowledgeable party </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">install your ERRCS</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and perform </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ERRCS testing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to check it for any maintenance issues regularly.</span></p>
<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ERRCS systems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are a vital lifeline that extends between people in any sort of danger within any building, and the heroes who risk their lives trying to save them every day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is why we take our work extremely seriously and aim to provide nothing but the most flawless communications systems available today.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An emergency responder radio communications system (ERRCS) is a critical component of emergency response systems. It&#8217;s the primary tool for communication between emergency first responders and dispatch centers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reliability of an ERRCS is crucial since it can affect response times and may even lead to needless injuries or death in times of crisis. However, many factors outside a dispatch center&#8217;s control can affect an ERRCS&#8217;s reliability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This blog will explore ERRCS, how external factors affect its reliability, and why maintenance is essential for ensuring optimal functionality at all times!</span></p>
<h3><b>The Reliability of an ERRCS</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may be wondering if the ERRCS is reliable. The answer is yes! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system provides reliable communications and redundancy using two separate radio transmission paths. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">External factors such as water, wind, or power outages are not supposed to affect your ERRCS signal. These systems are designed to resist the elements and are engineered to rely on a backup system during a power outage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, ERRCS Systems are engineered with strength and redundancy, as buildings might be subject to an array of emergency events, and it can be challenging to assess eventualities in mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, RF engineering and design factors in eventualities to ensure systems are implemented with fire, flood, and natural event risks in mind. </span></p>
<h3><b>ERRCS Maintenance</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s essential to perform an Annual Testing and Recertification, or ATR, as mandated by the NFPA and authority having jurisdictions, as it ensures your ERRCS performs at optimal performance at all times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is essential to note that we do advise contacting your provider for such tasks. We at DAS Systems consider each client a partner, allowing us to form long-term relationships with them to tend to their needs, certifications, maintenance, and the like. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Maintenance of an Emergency Responder Radio Communications System is a significant part of emergency response and disaster management plans. It can be costly, but its purpose is to save lives and assets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most common external factors that may affect an ERRCS are not necessarily poor weather conditions but rather aging systems and lack of maintenance by the operator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you looking to maintain your ERRCS on your premise? </span><a href="https://www.peercom.orgproposal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reach out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a consultation! </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Public Safety Communications system is a wireless communication system used by first responders and emergency services personnel, providing seamless two-way communication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people mistakenly think that A DAS system can be used as an ERRCS solution, but this isn&#8217;t the case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what are the differences between an ERRCS and a DAS system? Let&#8217;s look at what they are designed to do, how they work, and where they&#8217;re typically deployed.</span></p>
<h3><b>What Is A DAS System?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Distributed Antenna System (DAS) is a system of antennas installed in a building to enhance and enable carrier services throughout a structure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DAS systems are most commonly installed indoors and typically consist of multiple antenna nodes connected by a fiber optic cable network. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, they may also be installed at outdoor stadiums, arenas, or malls with limited cell tower coverage. Geography and building materials can also affect poor cell reception and impact a business&#8217;s performance during peak operations. </span></p>
<h3>DAS Is Connectivity Focused</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distributed Antenna Systems are designed to provide building-wide connectivity. It ensures every floor, room, and corner has access to reliable carrier service, providing occupants, visitors, and businesses with complete coverage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DAS Systems can support voice, data, and video services to multiple cellular carriers on the same system using a combination of RF engineering and expertise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a Cellular DAS System is useful for providing potential victims with a lifeline by ensuring a reliable connection, a DAS is very different from an ERRCS. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s important to distinguish these two systems from one another, given the difference in purpose, design, compliance, and resilience. </span></p>
<h3>What Is An ERRCS?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Emergency Responder Radio Communications System, or ERRCS, ensures reliable and redundant two-way communication for first responders within building structures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These systems use communications compatible with existing public safety radio frequencies to ensure that first responders, paramedical professionals, and public safety personnel communicate safely.</span></p>
<h3>ERRCS Mandated By Authorities</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ERRCS systems are mandated by the NFPA and Authority Having Jurisdictions (AHJs), while cellular DAS systems are not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most buildings that meet a specific size and occupancy threshold, which varies from city to city, must have an ERRCS system installed and be subjected to Annual Testing and Recertification (ATR). </span></p>
<h3>Value Through DAS And ERRCS</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While underestimated, cellular DAS systems can significantly appreciate the value of any venue or building. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is evidenced by bad cell reception which instantly turns away possible tenants looking to rent or purchase property in your building. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ERRCS are more straightforward since their existence on-premises is mandated by the NFPA, as the system supports first responders and protects occupants. This adds an extra layer of value that property owners and managers can capitalize on to increase their standing in the market. </span></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ERRCS and DAS can be great options depending on your needs and budget. However, it&#8217;s essential to understand their differences to find the right solution for your communications system.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you looking to dive deeper into both systems? </span><a href="https://www.peercom.orgproposal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reach out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to us for a consultation! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve all experienced lousy reception in certain areas and sections of a building or structure. It’s considered a significant cause of frustration for current tenants while deterring future tenants from being attracted to the building.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But let’s dive deeper into this frustrating phenomenon to understand what’s happening on the technical side. </span></p>
<h3><b>What is Signal Strength?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To understand signal strength, it’s essential first to understand the concept of radio frequency (RF). Radiofrequency is a form of electromagnetic radiation transmitted via antennas and cables. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Devices use this form of energy to communicate with one another. The RF spectrum includes everything from AM/FM radio waves to microwaves used by mobile phones and Wi-Fi routers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An individual device will have a specified range of transmitting signals. This range falls within the definition of “good” or “bad” signal strength based on how reliable and accurate any given device needs its data to be for it to work effectively at all times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this may seem obvious, many factors impact how effective your cellular service provider’s network might be outside your home or office building. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weather conditions such as rainstorms or snowstorms can impact cell towers; even something as simple as construction near an existing tower site could cause interference from other wireless signals being broadcast nearby (or vice versa).</span></p>
<h3><b>What Qualifies A Good Or Bad Signal Strength</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signal strength is the amount of power transmitted over a given distance. It’s measured in dBm (decibels relative to 1 milliwatt), with higher numbers indicating better signal strength and vice versa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signal strength is affected by obstructions, distance, and the number of wireless devices used. A good signal strength should be approximately between -50 dBm to -25 dBm on a cellular device.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Effects of Signal Strength</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poor signal strength can affect workplace efficiency in several ways. For example, you may experience slow mobile Internet speeds or have trouble making or receiving calls. This is especially true if you’re in an area with poor reception, such as a basement or underground parking garage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poor signal strength can also affect occupant safety: it could prevent people from receiving warning notifications about potential hazards (such as fire alarms), which could cause them to leave their workspace too soon or not evacuate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can also disrupt medical equipment workers with disabilities and make it challenging to communicate with emergency responders if necessary (for example, during an active shooter situation).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poor signal strength can also impact public safety and other commercial wireless communications. For example, police officers may be unable to access real-time data from their body cameras during emergencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firefighters may need to receive information about dangerous chemicals stored at nearby businesses. Construction workers might work on unsafe bridges because they need to learn that government inspectors recently inspected the bridge.</span></p>
<h3><b>Good Signal Strength For Public Safety</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding public safety and other commercial wireless communications, a reasonable signal strength requirement provides minimal latency, low packet loss, good voice quality, low jitter, and high throughput. Good coverage is also crucial so that the system will work in areas of high demand or remote locations where there may not be any other options available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll need to balance power consumption with coverage capabilities and capacity requirements to achieve this goal. For example, suppose you want your system to cover an area with poor reception. In that case, you may need higher transmission power than if your system operates at an airport or stadium where there’s no interference from surrounding buildings or trees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These factors can decrease the range of signals traveling over longer distances due to absorption by objects such as concrete walls or tall trees.</span></p>
<h3><b>How Does Cellular DAS Ensure Good Signal Strength?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its design is one of the essential factors in ensuring that a Cellular DAS system provides good signal strength. Every location where a DAS is installed has its unique set of challenges, and it’s crucial to have an experienced designer who can bring together all of these elements to create a solution that works well for your specific location.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, there are many ways to increase this type of system’s impact on overall cell phone connectivity. For example:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re using multiple providers, it’s vital to ensure that each provider has the bandwidth they need to provide quality service. You should also consider adding nodes or repeaters if you want more coverage or throughput capacity than what one node offers by itself.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Importance of Good Signal Strength</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good signal strength is significant for your in-building wireless system. The higher your signal strength, the more reliable connections will be and the better it will perform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A strong signal means you can move around freely without losing connectivity or experiencing dropped calls. In addition to ensuring that your employees can connect and their devices, a strong signal also ensures that they do so safely by providing them with access to vital information about their surroundings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poor signal strength can cause problems such as missed deadlines due lack of communication between departments which may result in disciplinary action being taken against them (or worse).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you are trying to increase your coverage and capacity or want to ensure proper connectivity for your business, installing a Cellular DAS is the best way to do this. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will help you get the most out of your wireless network and ensure that no matter where an employee goes in your building, there will always be good signal strength available for them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NFPA is a nonprofit organization established in 1896, offering an essential set of codes and standards for fire protection, electrical, and life safety in the workplace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to their website, &#8220;the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) provides a wide array of resources for public fire service professionals and private citizens alike&#8230;Our mission is to reduce the worldwide burden of fire and other hazards on the quality of life by providing and advocating scientifically-based consensus codes and standards, research, training, and education.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But before diving into it all, we must answer some basic questions.</span></p>
<h3><b>What is an ERRCS?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emergency Responder Radio Communications Systems (ERRCS) provide a reliable, secure and interoperable solution for first responders. They allow communication between police departments, fire departments, EMS units, and other emergency response agencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to these benefits, ERRCS can be used to dispatch all types of emergencies at any time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ERRCS are designed to be easy to use and maintain, they provide a reliable solution for emergency responders. These systems can be used in any emergency, such as natural disasters, fires, or other emergencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NFPA requires that &#8220;Buildings and structures that cannot support the required level of radio coverage shall be equipped with a radiating cable system or a distributed antenna system (DAS) with FCC-certified signal boosters, or both, or with a system that is otherwise approved, to achieve the required adequate radio coverage.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several factors that can affect the communications standards in-building for first responders, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signal Strength</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isolation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">System Radio Frequencies</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frequency Changes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critical Areas</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radio Coverage</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another main component of NFPA 72 Section 24.5.2 is non-interference. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, &#8220;no amplification system capable of operating on frequencies or causing interference on frequencies assigned to the jurisdiction by the FCC shall be installed without prior coordination and approval of the authority having jurisdiction,&#8221; according to the NFPA. &#8220;The building manager/owner shall suspend and correct other equipment installations that degrade the performance of the public safety radio or public safety radio enhancement system.&#8221; </span></p>
<h3><b>What is an NFPA Certification?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFPA certification is a requirement for many public safety organizations, structures, and buildings. The NFPA guides the design and construction of emergency response radio communication systems (ERRCS).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These gold public safety standards are developed by the consensus of experts in the field and are voluntary, but they are widely used throughout the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most cases, compliance with NFPA standards is voluntary. However, in some cases, federal or state Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) agencies have incorporated wording from NFPA standards into regulations. In these cases, complying with the standards is mandatory.</span></p>
<h3><b>The importance of an NFPA Gold Standard</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Committees of experts develop NFPA standards, updated regularly by fire marshals and other authorities having jurisdiction (AHJs). NFPA standards have become a standard for the industry to create, design, test, and maintain emergency response vehicles to be used safely in the field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The certification has many different standards that guide how organizations and structures should operate. The purpose behind these guidelines is to put: safety first!</span></p>
<h3><b>The Added Value of an NFPA</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Fire Protection Association is the leading authority on fire safety. With more than 120 years of experience, NFPA has developed a wide range of training and certification programs that help you meet your goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an independent, nonprofit organization, NFPA offers free resources to help you understand the codes you must comply with. Contact us today if you want to learn more about how this code can benefit your business and make it safer for employees and customers alike!</span></p>
<h3><b>Building Partnerships with Providers</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These certifications and standards might seem somewhat intimidating to contractors, building managers, or owners, especially if they want to bolster their public safety capabilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This emphasizes having a solid relationship with a DAS/ERRCS provider with strong relationships with fire marshals and AHJs, which streamline the entire process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only would you be leveraging their skills, know-how, and knowledge in the field, but also tap into their network to remain as compliant as possible while meeting client expectations. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public safety DAS </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is an essential component of any building&#8217;s communications system. It&#8217;s one of the most critical systems for any business or facility exposed to potential emergencies. It must be able to communicate with first responders in real-time.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">public safety DAS </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">include hospitals, schools, residential buildings, and other public buildings with a large surface area and a considerable amount of people within these buildings.</span></p>
<h3>What is a public safety DAS?</h3>
<p><b> </b><a href="https://www.peercom.orgthe-need-of-public-safety-das/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">public safety DAS </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(PSD)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a network of antennas and radio access points installed in a building to improve first responder communications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First responders use a PSD to communicate with each other and their commanding officers, command centers, and other agencies. Such as firefighters and police officers working in co-op during an intervention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As structures age, it is pivotal to maintain adequate safety standards that meet modern requirements, offering occupants and first responders the benefit of increased security.</span></p>
<h3>DAS system requirements for older buildings</h3>
<p><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DAS system requirements </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for older buildings are the same as those for new construction, although several factors can affect the quality of your system and its performance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building age and structural integrity</span></li>
<li>Design challenges, such as wiring and power distribution systems</li>
<li>Difficulty in installing adequate backup power if needed</li>
<li>NFPA and IFC safety code requirements</li>
<li>Maintaining reasonable costs while upkeeping building safety and aesthetics<b> </b></li>
</ul>
<h3>Public safety DAS is a crucial component of any building&#8217;s communications system</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">public safety DAS</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a core component of any building&#8217;s communications system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It provides the first responder instant access to critical communication networks, allowing them to plan and execute evacuation routes in building layouts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It effectively improves emergency response times and quality while preventing loss of life and property damage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This technology enables firefighters, police officers, and other emergency responders to communicate effectively during an emergency by using high-speed data transfer speeds (1 gigabit per second), that exceed typical phone line transmission speeds (384 kilobits per second).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A DAS system can be used by multiple agencies simultaneously when needed—for example during large-scale events like hurricanes or tornadoes—and allows everyone involved on scene unparalleled usage of their voice communication systems, which may not always be reliable due to weather conditions or distance from base stations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users will know exactly where they&#8217;re supposed to be and what to do, not only because they&#8217;ve been trained but because their communications systems have tuned into existing systems around them.</span></p>
<h3>What is the importance of public safety DAS in an older building?</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.peercom.orgerrcs-mandatory-for-building-owners/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Code compliance is essential</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to any short- and long-term fire safety plan. This helps to ensure that occupants and first responders alike are well-equipped to handle emergencies and increase the odds of survival during unexpected Events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adopting a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">public safety DAS </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">system will provide first responders with the information needed to make quick decisions during an emergency while promoting better evacuation procedures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is critical in older structures where the following factors should be upheld:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building materials may not be fire resistant, causing a quick escalation of the situation.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">An aged and weakened structure that is more prone to collapsing.</span></li>
<li>Older architectural designs that are less considerate of fire safety plans</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public safety DAS </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a core component of any older building&#8217;s communications and emergency safety systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It provides the backup first responders need and ensures their access to the network during an emergency. In turn, their communications remain constant and reliable, ensuring their coverage remains intact, especially in older buildings.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distributed Antenna Systems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are a common requirement for most building structures. Whether it is a public safety, code, or building comfort/experience requirement, a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> DAS system </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">serves to provide and improve carrier coverage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DAS systems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are, therefore, a common requirement for most building structures in the US. Depending on the building type, size, regulation, and, most importantly, your needs will vary in requirements and specifications.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, this versatility is highly scalable and designed to work around all applications, providing businesses and users exceptional coverage, productivity, comfort, and safety throughout a building structure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundamentally though, different types of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DAS system</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s exist, as they serve a specific purpose and need to work around different engineering and budgeting constraints. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This blog post covers the different types of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> DAS systems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and which one might be a potential fit for you.</span></p>
<h3>Indoor DAS</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indoor DAS</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the most common DAS system installed by businesses like hotels, libraries, conference centers, closed-roof stadiums, offices, and corporate spaces. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is installed in buildings and provides wireless coverage for many users that span multiple floors, large surface areas, and coverage issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s also most frequently adopted in buildings with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bad phone reception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, particularly in signal-blocking materials such as low-E glass, thick cement walls, and a dense number of users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of system is versatile with variants that offer passive and hybrid power options, placing costs at less than </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outdoor DAS</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Active DAS systems. </span></p>
<h3>Outdoor DAS</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outdoor DAS</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> systems are indoor DAS systems with weatherproofing. As their name suggests, this system is dedicated to outdoor applications for venues like stadiums, resorts, campuses, parks, and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While essentially the same system of antennas and nodes, an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">outdoor DAS</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requires Remote Radio Heads, RHHs, which are housed in weatherproof outdoor enclosures. They are placed on rooftops, poles, or walls to increase outdoor carrier coverage.</span></p>
<h3>Hybrid DAS</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hybrid DAS is a combination of both indoor and outdoor </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DAS</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The indoor portion of the hybrid system is usually installed inside a building, while the outdoor portion is installed outside the building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of system provides coverage for areas that require a dual application through a single system that provides a single zone, bypassing wireless handoff issues. A Hybrid DAS is a single system that is both scalable and as reliable as can be configured to the building&#8217;s needs. </span></p>
<h3>Active and Passive DAS</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the most common type of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DAS Systems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> installed today is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Active DAS</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which essentially means that components require a power source to operate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system utilizes fiber optic cables to connect with remote nodes. In contrast, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passive DAS </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">system foregoes the fiber optic cables in most cases and makes use of Bi-Directional Amplifiers or BDAs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passive DAS</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a system that uses the existing cellular network to distribute cellular signals. It&#8217;s an ideal solution for areas with a need for additional coverage on a budget for small buildings and office spaces. </span></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DAS </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a great way to improve your building and venue network coverage by offering unparalleled network access, efficiency, and safety.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different businesses require different applications, and while there are universal DAS solutions, there is no &#8220;one size fits all.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DAS systems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> engineers can help you value-engineer a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DAS system </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that covers your needs. </span><a href="https://www.peercom.orgproposal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact us</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to learn how we can help you assess your need for a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DAS system</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and design a bespoke system that works for your old building&#8217;s code requirements.</span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Why an ERRCS is so common</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the September 11th attacks in New York City, emergency workers had trouble speaking to one another during the search and rescue operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These challenges included complete radio communication failures. This caused first responders within buildings to lose touch with dispatch and fire teams outside, placing their lives in danger and hindering rescue attempts.</p>
<p></span></p>
<h3><b>How and why ERRCS offer life-saving public safety systems</b></h3>
<p><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Emergency Responder Radio Coverage System, or ERRCS installation within a building or structure is vital, it touches down on a matter of life and death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, it has become </span><a href="https://www.peercom.orgerrcs-and-carrier-das-for-government/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a requirement within the United States</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that building owners must install on-site </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ERRCS systems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication failures on 9/11 raised awareness on the significance of well-functioning ERRCS. The event effectively emphasized the necessity for tools that would allow responders to communicate in the case of an emergency without interruption or signal loss. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 9/11, legislators, stakeholders, and commercial building owners have made ERRCS installation, testing, and recertification a top concern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ERRCS system</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aims to boost critical communications to first responders in and around a building to get the word out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An ERRCS operates through an extension of the public safety network by leveraging a setlist of small antennas extracted from a </span><a href="https://www.peercom.orgservices/wireless-carrier-das/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">distributed antenna system (DAS)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The system effectively allows all users to send and receive radio signals throughout the area and to base stations.</p>
<p></span></p>
<h3><b>What goes into annual testing and recertification</b></h3>
<p><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is your building equipped with a public safety signal booster or an ERRCS? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If so, when was the last time an expert had your system inspected? If it has been more than a year, your equipment may no longer meet current standard safety requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An annual assessment of your system will generally analyze eight or more components to confirm that the system continues to run and perform in accordance with NFPA, IFC, and local code compliance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These systems include, but are not limited to: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">System Coverage</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pathway Survivability</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donor Isolation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment Alarms</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distributed Antenna System</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (DAS) is a wireless communications system that uses multiple antennas to provide coverage in an area. These systems can be used for point-to-point connections or multipoint connections, which allow you to connect many users with one base station.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A DAS is a network of interconnected hardware and software that allows mobile devices to transmit data using multiple antennas instead of just one. </span><a href="https://www.peercom.orghow-das-works-and-is-used/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s used in various industries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including cellular networks, wireless networks, private enterprise networks, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this blog post, we dive deeper into </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">what are distributed systems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and what makes up </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DAS systems components</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and how they work together to get you the coverage needed throughout your building.</span></p>
<h3><b>A- Base Station</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A base station is a central hub that connects all the other components of DAS directly to a fiber optic network, emitting radio frequency (RF) signals out through the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">coaxial cables</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> running throughout your building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This allows you to control everything from one location, as base stations can be connected through hardwired connections or wireless networks, with each having respective advantages and disadvantages:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hardwired connections are faster than wireless ones because they don&#8217;t need networked devices between them and their destination (the remote radio heads). This makes it easier for businesses that need access quickly without sacrificing quality or security concerns.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wireless networks use antennas distributed throughout buildings, so each room has its own signal strength. This means you&#8217;ll probably have less coverage across your entire facility if there aren&#8217;t enough antennas installed everywhere.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>B- Fiber Optics</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiber optics send data from the base station to the antenna. A fiber optic cable is made of glass or plastic, which means it carries light signals and not electrical signals. It can rapidly transmit large amounts of information through extremely thin wires without losing any signal quality.</span></p>
<h3><b>C- Radio Frequency Cables</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RF cables are high-quality cables used to connect antennas to the base station. They&#8217;re also known as RF </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">coaxial cables</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since they appear like an old-fashioned cord used to connect your TV to your antenna.</span></p>
<h3><b>D- </b><b>Coaxial Cable</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coaxial cable</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a type of cable that consists of an inner conductor surrounded by a tubular insulator, which is surrounded by another conductor. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coaxial cables</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are used in many devices, including computers and televisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main advantage of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">coaxial cable</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over other types of cables is that it can carry large amounts of power (wattage), while still having low losses and high bandwidth capacity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This makes it ideal for high-speed data transmission over long distances, such as between cities.</span></p>
<h3>E- Connectors and splitters</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connectors link fiber optic cables, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">coaxial cables</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and RF cables to the antenna. These connectors can be made of plastic or metal, and come in different shapes and sizes depending on the type of connection that is required by your application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, splitters are used to distribute the signal to multiple devices. They are passive devices that split a cable into two channels and then connect them in series with each other.</span></p>
<h3><b> F- Antennas</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antennas are used to transmit and receive radio waves and signals; they&#8217;re also known as phased array antennas or directional arrays because they can be rotated or tilted to focus their signal in a specific direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is important for wireless communication because it allows you to send your message over long distances without losing quality along the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antennas come in many shapes and sizes, but all of them share two basic components: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An electrical circuit that transmits electricity through wires (called transmission lines) into another device</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An antenna that converts that signal into an electromagnetic wave so it can travel through space and reach its destination at high speeds (or even faster).</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DAS Network</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a powerful tool that can enhance your building and business communications network and </span><a href="https://www.peercom.orgdas-business-development-strategy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business development strategy.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A DAS capitalizes on simple and reliable components that improve a user&#8217;s overall connectivity and experience, which subsequently generates added value throughout your business.</span></p>
