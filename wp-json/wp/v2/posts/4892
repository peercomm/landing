First responder radio systems are lifelines and therefore, all parties involved in the deployment process should prioritize it as such. As a property owner or manager, the top concern is ensuring the safety of all tenants, staff, and visitors alike. When disasters strike within property grounds, the subsequent seconds are critical. The performance of your structures public safety distributed antenna system determine first responders ability to perform their duties effectively, as communication is key. Ultimately, this responsibility falls in the hands of the property owner(s) and management.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, it is imperative to ensure that communication frequencies are operating at optimum levels, once your Emergency Responder Radio Coverage System (ERRCS) is deployed. In order to increase the effectiveness of deployed systems across the board, The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nfpa.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)<\/a> has set minimal standards for wireless signal strength powering structural ERRCS (specifically -95dB). This measure affects all first responder radio systems at large &#8212; new construction and currently occupied buildings. DAS system deployments vary in complexity depending on the structural design. The cellular signal equipment your organization decides to deploy at the planning phase impacts its overall performance. The Peer Communications team of experts ensures to design and assemble a solution that adheres to your project needs in a cost-effective fashion.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, some of the factors known to affect the performance of your responder system began with its design, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The physical design of the structure<\/li>\n<li>The density of its respective walls<\/li>\n<li>The use of concrete and other reinforcing materials<\/li>\n<li>The use of energy efficient glass and insulation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Consequently, many of these decisions are known to diminish, impede, and\/or restrict radio signal bands utilized by emergency responders. At Peer Communications, we value the importance of proper planning with first-rate designers and engineers, a thorough deployment process that meets all of your ecosystem needs, and post-construction support. As determined above, the right cellular DAS solution can help first responders do their job effectively, ensuring the safety of building tenants, visitors and staff during emergencies.<\/p>\n<p>Its turn-key solution enables Peer Communications to take your project from start to finish, while providing cross-integration with leading carriers across the nation.
