Let&#8217;s look at what they are designed to do, how they work, and where they&#8217;re typically deployed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>What Is A DAS System?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Distributed Antenna System (DAS) is a system of antennas installed in a building to enhance and enable carrier services throughout a structure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DAS systems are most commonly installed indoors and typically consist of multiple antenna nodes connected by a fiber optic cable network.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, they may also be installed at outdoor stadiums, arenas, or malls with limited cell tower coverage. Geography and building materials can also affect poor cell reception and impact a business&#8217;s performance during peak operations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>DAS Is Connectivity Focused<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Distributed Antenna Systems are designed to provide building-wide connectivity. It ensures every floor, room, and corner has access to reliable carrier service, providing occupants, visitors, and businesses with complete coverage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DAS Systems can support voice, data, and video services to multiple cellular carriers on the same system using a combination of RF engineering and expertise.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While a Cellular DAS System is useful for providing potential victims with a lifeline by ensuring a reliable connection, a DAS is very different from an ERRCS.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s important to distinguish these two systems from one another, given the difference in purpose, design, compliance, and resilience.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What Is An ERRCS?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An Emergency Responder Radio Communications System, or ERRCS, ensures reliable and redundant two-way communication for first responders within building structures.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These systems use communications compatible with existing public safety radio frequencies to ensure that first responders, paramedical professionals, and public safety personnel communicate safely.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>ERRCS Mandated By Authorities<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ERRCS systems are mandated by the NFPA and Authority Having Jurisdictions (AHJs), while cellular DAS systems are not.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most buildings that meet a specific size and occupancy threshold, which varies from city to city, must have an ERRCS system installed and be subjected to Annual Testing and Recertification (ATR).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Value Through DAS And ERRCS<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While underestimated, cellular DAS systems can significantly appreciate the value of any venue or building.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is evidenced by bad cell reception which instantly turns away possible tenants looking to rent or purchase property in your building.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ERRCS are more straightforward since their existence on-premises is mandated by the NFPA, as the system supports first responders and protects occupants. This adds an extra layer of value that property owners and managers can capitalize on to increase their standing in the market.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ERRCS and DAS can be great options depending on your needs and budget. However, it&#8217;s essential to understand their differences to find the right solution for your communications system.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you looking to dive deeper into both systems? <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.peercom.org\/proposal\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reach out<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to us for a consultation! <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A Public Safety Communications system is a wireless communication system used by first responders and emergency services personnel, providing seamless two-way communication.
