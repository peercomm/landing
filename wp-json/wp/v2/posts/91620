Sometimes, multiple BTS systems are deployed to receive signals from different carriers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Pros<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Performance is top of mind here, especially since it includes an extra layer of capacity for high-occupancy districts that might contains stadiums, airports, or venues.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cons<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The priciest of the bunch, BTS systems are considered the slowest when looking to install since providers need to provide their own dedicated cables to run signals through. In parallel, they require bigger space, more cooling, and consume more power which would result in higher expenses across the board.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u200d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Small Cells<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Used as an alternative form of DAS, small cells are used as signal sources for these systems.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They work to provide safe tunnels back to networks through the Internet to create a high-quality wireless signal. Small cells are rolled out for public mobile networks through indoor areas.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Pros<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Considered cheaper and much faster to install than their BTS counterparts, they have the ability to create excellent quality wireless signals for dense structures.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cons<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem here is its availability since not all telcos tend to offer small cells. In parallel, they require backhaul internet connections, since they are difficult to expand for even more users in large areas.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to discover more about our DAS systems and which ones work where <a href=\"https:\/\/www.peercom.org\/proposal\/\">reach out to us<\/a> directly!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Data is increasingly being transmitted through almost every device we own, be them big or small.\u00a0 It is truly the age of the Internet of Things (IoT), especially with the rise of the fifth generation of mobile networks (5G).\u00a0 With that in mind, every device that can send and receive data is fitted with a [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":99270,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[29],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.11 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>The 3 Types of DAS Signal Sources, &amp;
