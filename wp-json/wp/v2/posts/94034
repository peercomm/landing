The smart factories of tomorrow will contain a sea with devices, sensors, and robotics that will depend on the speed of 5G to operate within split-second tasks.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A recent study by research firm Absolute Reports highlighted that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the global 5G Equipment market is estimated to be worth $6.21 billion in 2022 and is forecast to be a readjusted size of $11.49 billion by 2028 with a CAGR of 10.8 percent.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will significantly impact 5G\u2019s reach into manufacturing and has already started to surface within some tech companies \u2013 such as Tesla\u2019s Gigafactories \u2013 leading the charge for more connected production lines.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this to happen, the factories of tomorrow must start deploying distributed antenna systems (DAS) to begin the transitioning online, leveraging the power of 5G to optimize the entire process.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The integrated DAS systems will allow for the free flow of bandwidth and information to command centers set up within the factory floor to control, adjust, and monitor the manufacturing process, intervening when necessary. In parallel, the factory\u2019s output will significantly increase via data presented by the many devices and sensors deployed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the world becomes ever more connected, especially with the rise in IoT devices worldwide, DAS systems will continue to see significant growth in the decade to come, as it will host the coming digital world of the metaverse.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have some questions about DAS systems in your building? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dassystems.com\/proposal\/\">Reach out to us<\/a> for an expert consultation!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It is beautiful to think that a tiny technological advancement \u2013 be it software or hardware \u2013 can send shockwaves over industries from all walks of life, regardless of vocation.
