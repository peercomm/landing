However, not all solutions are built the same, as such, DAS Systems specializes in DAS that amplify public safety communication via Radio Frequency (RF) signal coverage throughout large building structures and across campus settings.<\/p>\n<p>DAS Systems\u2019 in-building wireless DAS solutions deliver reliable, clear indoor communication coverage for first responders when it matters most &#8212; during life threatening situations. Therefore, even if a particular terrain is primed for a DAS solution, it\u2019s important to note that indoor spaces should be covered by Active DAS, while outdoor spaces require Passive DAS. The latest generation of DAS solutions can also integrate both Active and Passive networks into a cohesive, hybrid platform for complex corporate ecosystems.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Right Solution<\/strong><br \/>\nFor facilities managers, building owners and architects, in-building wireless solutions should be a top priority, to ensure the best enterprise connectivity options available. DAS is an inherently scalable and versatile solution, naturally, it means that stakeholders can expand coverage on larger campuses and uniquely shaped areas. As one can imagine, there\u2019s a multitude of factors to consider when selecting a DAS solution to deploy. There\u2019s no such thing as a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 solution; therefore, the dimensions of the infrastructure and the location in which it is located, the energy usage and overhead costs, as well as the number of operators necessary &#8212; are just a few points to address. Ultimately, these elements will greatly influence which DAS solution is the best option for your project.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Requirements<\/strong><br \/>\nSo, what do these comprehensive solutions require? Generally speaking, DAS infrastructures rely on RF cable (coaxial cable) to sync antenna remotes and preferably fiber-optic cable to connect floors and other discrete areas. These two types of cable then connect to a central processing point (commonly known as the headend). However, advanced DAS solutions operate on IT structured cabling instead of coaxial. This offers a number of benefits, from ease of use for installers and reduced overhead costs, to supporting supplementary networks and functions such as Wi-Fi and security systems.<\/p>\n<p>Click <a href=\"https:\/\/www.peercom.org\/account-set-up-form\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a> to contact us and learn more about how DAS Systems can help your organization integrate an effective and cost-effective ERRCS system.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Built from a series of remote antennas, Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) is one of the industry&#8217;s greatest milestones as it has been instrumental in enabling wireless coverage and capacity technologies for businesses the world over.
