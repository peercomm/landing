The introduction of 4G LTE radically reformed broadband networking on mobile devices. The immense changes brought forth to society and consumers at large were enabled by massive increases in network throughput. This technological revolution in broadband networks has enabled novel ecosystems around the mobile application economy. <\/p>\n<p>Despite the unpredictable transformation to our infrastructures that 4G provided in recent years, we are on the verge of a fundamental transformation with 5G, in respect to supporting architectures. This is in light of the fact that new constructs, capable of supporting exponentially greater numbers of critical IoT applications will emerge, alongside 5G. In regards to indoor networks, 5G networks will be the cause of an enhanced consumer experience, a vast surge in broadband speeds&#8211;with zero to low latency for user endpoints. However, this isn\u2019t possible without a leading Distributed Antenna System (DAS) in place, capable of channeling the cellular coverage indoors and on multiple stories. The DAS spectrum enables the signal to enter any structure from a base station and through a carrier feed, which then disperses that signal throughout the covered floors. <\/p>\n<p>This improvement to indoor infrastructures will compliment Emergency Responder Radio Coverage Systems (ERRCS) and communication services overall. 5G introduces necessary evolutionary changes compared to previous generations, as such, Peer Communications has evaluated the best approaches to bring these new capabilities to indoor spaces. DAS structures (passive, active, and the best option being hybrid) can be deployed synergistically with small cells to save space and create an economical solution. A hybrid DAS integrates the capabilities from both active and passive systems, making it the optimal choice for organizations and venues looking to expand 5G capability. Thus, the pathway for indoor 5G is paved by hybrid DAS and small cells. <\/p>\n<p>The Peer Communications team of experts are capable of helping your organization spearhead the design, engineering, and installation of the wireless infrastructure necessary to support your ecosystem. Its turn-key solution, enables Peer Communications to take your project from start to finish, while providing cross-integration with leading carriers across the nation. <\/p>\n<p>Click <a href=\"https:\/\/www.peercom.org\/proposal\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a> to contact us and learn more about how Peer Communications can help your organization integrate 5G. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>5G is positioned to disrupt nearly every industry the world over, yet the vast majority of businesses do not understand what it is.
