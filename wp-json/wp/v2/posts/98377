Whether it is a public safety, code, or building comfort\/experience requirement, a<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> DAS system <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">serves to provide and improve carrier coverage.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DAS systems<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are, therefore, a common requirement for most building structures in the US. Depending on the building type, size, regulation, and, most importantly, your needs will vary in requirements and specifications.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, this versatility is highly scalable and designed to work around all applications, providing businesses and users exceptional coverage, productivity, comfort, and safety throughout a building structure.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundamentally though, different types of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DAS system<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s exist, as they serve a specific purpose and need to work around different engineering and budgeting constraints.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This blog post covers the different types of<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> DAS systems<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and which one might be a potential fit for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Indoor DAS<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indoor DAS<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the most common DAS system installed by businesses like hotels, libraries, conference centers, closed-roof stadiums, offices, and corporate spaces.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is installed in buildings and provides wireless coverage for many users that span multiple floors, large surface areas, and coverage issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s also most frequently adopted in buildings with <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bad phone reception<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, particularly in signal-blocking materials such as low-E glass, thick cement walls, and a dense number of users.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This type of system is versatile with variants that offer passive and hybrid power options, placing costs at less than <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outdoor DAS<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and Active DAS systems.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Outdoor DAS<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outdoor DAS<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> systems are indoor DAS systems with weatherproofing. As their name suggests, this system is dedicated to outdoor applications for venues like stadiums, resorts, campuses, parks, and more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While essentially the same system of antennas and nodes, an <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">outdoor DAS<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> requires Remote Radio Heads, RHHs, which are housed in weatherproof outdoor enclosures. They are placed on rooftops, poles, or walls to increase outdoor carrier coverage.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Hybrid DAS<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A hybrid DAS is a combination of both indoor and outdoor <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DAS<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The indoor portion of the hybrid system is usually installed inside a building, while the outdoor portion is installed outside the building.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This type of system provides coverage for areas that require a dual application through a single system that provides a single zone, bypassing wireless handoff issues. A Hybrid DAS is a single system that is both scalable and as reliable as can be configured to the building&#8217;s needs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Active and Passive DAS<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among the most common type of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DAS Systems<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> installed today is <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Active DAS<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which essentially means that components require a power source to operate.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The system utilizes fiber optic cables to connect with remote nodes. In contrast, a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Passive DAS <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">system foregoes the fiber optic cables in most cases and makes use of Bi-Directional Amplifiers or BDAs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Passive DAS<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a system that uses the existing cellular network to distribute cellular signals. It&#8217;s an ideal solution for areas with a need for additional coverage on a budget for small buildings and office spaces.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DAS <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a great way to improve your building and venue network coverage by offering unparalleled network access, efficiency, and safety.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Different businesses require different applications, and while there are universal DAS solutions, there is no &#8220;one size fits all.&#8221;\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is where our <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DAS systems<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> engineers can help you value-engineer a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DAS system <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that covers your needs.\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.peercom.org\/proposal\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact us<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to learn how we can help you assess your need for a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DAS system<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and design a bespoke system that works for your old building&#8217;s code requirements.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep up with our updates and announcements on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/das-systems\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LinkedIn<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DASSystemsInc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and check out our <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.peercom.org\/news\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">other blog posts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to learn more about our <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DAS solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Distributed Antenna Systems are a common requirement for most building structures.
