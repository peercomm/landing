The current technologies at hand are still in their infancy but have provided a massive leap forward.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among the technologies being researched is integrating in-vehicle distributed antenna systems (DAS). According to experts from the universities of Leeds, Kent, and Bournemouth in the UK, research into this tech aims to transform wireless methods operating on fast-moving vehicles facing increased impairments at high data rates.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, the research can also address small cellular cells considered the lifeblood of high data rate operation, as well reoccurring cell handovers defined by speed and size.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThis scenario can make use of data from inductive loops for traffic (vehicular and data) monitoring, prediction, grooming, and control. Central base stations driving distributed antenna units will facilitate this new bandwidth provision, and Radio-over-Fiber (RoF) is a technology proposed to achieve transparent data distribution. The replacement of coaxial cables with optical fibers is desirable,\u201d the study by the three British universities highlighted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cFiber transmission offers sufficient bandwidth with reduced loss over long distances and decreased electromagnetic interference. Low loss Single-Mode Fiber (SMF) is commonly deployed outdoors, while Multimode Fiber (MMF), with higher losses, is often pre-installed in buildings. Unfortunately, MMF is not of a quality that lends itself to broadband Radio-over-Fiber,\u201d it added.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accordingly, Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) view WiMAX technology as an opportunity to significantly enhance their delivery of peak rates up to 1Gbit\/s at fixed speeds and 100 Mbit\/s to mobile users via micro-cells.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cTheoretically, antennas are reciprocal, which means they can transmit and receive electromagnetic waves with similar properties. Antennas play a key role in wireless communications; the antenna performance is crucial to efficient electromagnetic propagation,\u201d the study said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCost-effective while efficient antenna units have been assessed for ITS in a highway scenario. The antennas designed and tested served the WiMAX standard over full-duplex bi-directional optical links. UWB technology is of global interest in modern communication systems due to its potential to deliver high-speed data rate transmissions with excellent immunity to multipath interference at low power consumption, low cost, and simple hardware configuration,\u201d it highlighted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The technology can significantly boost a vehicle\u2019s ability to provide mobility and connectivity to passengers while drastically minimizing expenses brought forth by wires. As the funds waterfall onto the tech industry, in-vehicle DAS will indeed receive its fair share of funding to reach new heights of connectivity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like to continue the conversation with us?
