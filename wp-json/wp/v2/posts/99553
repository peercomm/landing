How can you make sure that the people inside are able to communicate with emergency responders outside? Are occupants able to dial 911 from their cell phones? What if there is an urgent need to evacuate the building?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These questions are made all the more urgent by the fact that many buildings are made of materials that can impede <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cellular or communication signals<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how do you make sure that your building is safe for its occupants? How do you guarantee that first responders can communicate with building occupants seamlessly and efficiently?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The answer is simple: you<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.peercom.org\/services\/errcs\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">get a certified &amp; professional company to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">install an ERRCS<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in your building<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What are ERRCS, in a nutshell?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emergency Responder Radio Communications System, or ERRCS<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.peercom.org\/first-responder-communication-errcs-system\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an important <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">radio transmission<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tool that ensures reliable two-way communication for first responders within building structures<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s an <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in-building communication system<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> designed to improve critical communications within a building as well as allowing flawless communication with the outside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seeing the importance of this, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ERRCS systems<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are mandated by the NFPA and local Authority Having Jurisdictions (AHJs).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most buildings that meet a specific size and occupancy threshold, which varies from city to city, must have an <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ERRCS system<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> installed and be subjected to<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.peercom.org\/errcs-recertification-and-annual-testing\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Annual Testing and Recertification<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (ATR).<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>But how do ERRCS work, exactly?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ERRCS<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> uses a donor antenna to receive the radio signals from the local first responder network \u2013 signals that operate on private frequencies used by first responders.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These signals are then re-amplified within the building at the required locations to make sure there are no blind spots when it comes to connectivity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ERRCS systems<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> use communication tools compatible with existing public safety radio frequencies to ensure that first responders, paramedical professionals, and public safety personnel are able to communicate safely and efficiently, without being limited or restricted by signal existence or strength.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What do ERRCS guarantee?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Installing an <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ERRCS system<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> provides a safer world for us all. Its presence in the building is a safeguard against catastrophes happening because of lack of radio signals or proper connectivity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It helps first responders to manage any dangerous situation, from manmade disasters such as a raging fire or an explosion, to natural disasters like flash floods or typhoons. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ERRCS<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ensure the safety of both the people in danger and the people trying to help them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As such, it is vital to have a knowledgeable party <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">install your ERRCS<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and perform <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ERRCS testing<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to check it for any maintenance issues regularly.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion:<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ERRCS systems<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are a vital lifeline that extends between people in any sort of danger within any building, and the heroes who risk their lives trying to save them every day.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is why we take our work extremely seriously and aim to provide nothing but the most flawless communications systems available today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.peercom.org\/contacts\">Get in touch<\/a><\/strong> with us to get a detailed quotation for your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ERRCS installation<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A very important question that comes to the mind of any building owner: what if an emergency occurs in your building?
