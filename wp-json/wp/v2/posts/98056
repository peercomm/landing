Are there any places where reception gets weaker over time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, reflect on your current carrier, particularly if you have used the same cellular service provider for years. It&#8217;s easy to overlook the fact that you may have some issues with your cell phone coverage from the signal source, which could indicate the need for a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cellular DAS system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If so, this could indicate that some work needs to be done on upgrading or repairing equipment within those areas or upgrading your connectivity by installing your own antennas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Step 2: Identify and draft your primary expectations and needs<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second step is to<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.peercom.org\/how-das-works-and-is-used\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> identify and draft your primary expectations and needs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This is where you&#8217;ll be able to think through the most critical aspects of your project, such as coverage, capacity, cost, and time frame.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you&#8217;re drafting these expectations, it&#8217;s vital that they&#8217;re written in a way that allows for flexibility if certain things don&#8217;t pan out as expected, (e.g., if demand exceeds capacity) and as a reference point for potential partners to assist with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0For example:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coverage &#8211; What areas in your building or business need cellular service? How many people are likely to need coverage at any given time?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Capacity &#8211; How much bandwidth can we saturate with an average user population? Could other factors like weather or physical geography affect our ability to provide adequate service levels over time?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>\u00a0\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<h3><b>Step 3: Complete detailed design and budget<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you&#8217;ve understood what it means to implement a cellular DAS system, let&#8217;s look at how to budget for one.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understand the different components of a system. A cellular DAS comprises three main components: an antenna, a base station, and an amplifier. You&#8217;ll need to determine which ones apply in your case and choose accordingly based on what you want out of your system (i.e., higher capacity vs. longer battery life).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Determine what you need to achieve your goals by evaluating each component individually before moving forward with designing and building anything else (such as software or hardware upgrades later down the road when necessary).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Explain and elaborate on why certain features are essential to your business: For example, if someone wants better coverage indoors where there aren&#8217;t any outdoor obstructions.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cellular DAS is a great way to improve cellular coverage, but you need to get the proper scope and budget.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A key step in designing your DAS project is determining where you&#8217;re going with it. If your goal is just to improve your cell signal strength, then you can focus on getting a single-unit antenna at the top of your building or in an attic space. But if you want something more comprehensive (such as adding multiple antennas), then it&#8217;s time for some planning.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you decide how many cell sites (or towers) are needed based on the traffic patterns within your area, two things will determine how much money goes into each site: size and location(s).\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we mentioned above: Location matters! For instance: If there&#8217;s only one tower available within 500 feet from where people need service most often\u2014say near grocery stores\u2014then getting coverage from that tower might cost less than buying four smaller ones spread throughout town instead because fewer people would be able (or willing)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Step 4: Face reality<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You&#8217;ve put in the time, effort, and money to complete the job. Now it&#8217;s time to face reality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you build your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cellular DAS system<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you must decide what value for money means for your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not an easy question as many factors should be considered when determining these costs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>For example:<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What equipment will be used?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many users will access the service at any given time?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How much data will be transferred per month or week (or day)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Step 5: Onboard a qualified partner<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every endeavor comes with a challenge, and ensuring your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">distributed antenna system costs<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> meet your expectations, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.peercom.org\/look-and-choose-a-das-company\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">making sure you have the right partner is a pivotal task<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some of the main criteria you factor in when going through your research, tender, or procurement process:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choose a partner with experience in your area.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look for a partner who will be there for you long-term.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look for a partner who has a good reputation.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look for a partner with a good track record of success and reliability, which essentially means they have been around long enough to know what works, and how to get it done at an affordable price point!<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Conclusion\u00a0<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re looking to take your business to the next level and get the most out of your<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cellular DAS system<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it&#8217;s time for some serious budgeting.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can get a lot done with careful budgeting and a solid strategy as long as you look carefully and diligently at which features are necessary and which aren&#8217;t.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most importantly, identifying and working with the right partner will ultimately determine your investment&#8217;s short-and long-term success.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.peercom.org\/proposal\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact us<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to learn how we can help you with value engineering from start to finish.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep up with our updates and announcements on<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/das-systems\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> LinkedIn<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DASSystemsInc\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and check out our other<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.peercom.org\/news\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> blog posts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to learn more about our <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DAS solutions<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Cellular DAS is a great way to improve phone coverage.
