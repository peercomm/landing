This has created a data explosion for almost everything, from construction to media.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Society\u2019s leapfrog into a more connected era has rendered it to become extremely data-driven, as people look to leverage the power of the internet to innovate. Thus, the need for a stable, secure, and fast internet connection is vital when entering the Fourth Industrial Revolution.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An example of this could be seen in smart farming, where farmers are utilizing drone technology to measure even the tiniest of details from irrigation levels, moisture levels to sun exposure. This level of precision has brought with it a heap of information that needs to be delivered, communicated, and analyzed rapidly since effective decisions need to be taken based on the datasets created.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A recent report by the United Nations highlighted that the digitization of farms will save billions in waste and losses and improve the quality of food that we consume. \u201cThe collective ability of farmers to produce more food more efficiently may be how the world feeds the global population, which will hit nine billion by 2030,\u201d the report noted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In parallel, the emergence of the fifth generation of mobile networks has played a significant role in digitizing farms worldwide, especially with the increasing mushroom of vertical farms around the world.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But while many have heralded the coming of 5G as a saving grace to latency issues, it\u2019s still not enough. Smart farms will look to bolster their connectivity to the next level to absorb the massive number of datasets being created by Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To achieve this, robust Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) are required to provide wide-scale coverage to all devices pumping out information to farmers to make the right call over their crops.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On-premises cell coverage has become essential for organizations to operate efficiently. To get ready for this DAS Systems\u2019 Wireless Carrier, DAS offers pre-construction consulting, coverage testing, RF Design\/Engineering, DAS installation, maintenance, remote monitoring, and optimization.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those with indoor farming facilities, indoor network enhancements can be accomplished through multiple technical topologies (i.e. Repeaters, Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS), Wi-Fi calling, and more).
