Public Safety DAS enables wireless connectivity within radiuses, however, they can fail to withstand emergency scenarios such as floods, fires, and earthquakes. This diminishes communication amongst first-responder teams without the proper deployment.<\/p>\n<p>According to the ASTM E119 standard, cables are required to continually operate for two hours once exposed to fire at 1850 degrees. The 50-Ohm, two-hour fire rated coaxial cable meets the requirements of NFPA 72, NFPA 1221, and IFC Section 510, fire codes set forth for Emergency Responder Radio Coverage Systems (ERRCS). These mandates are to be followed in all new building structures and renovations. In addition to the above, DAS system deployments vary in complexity depending on the structural design. The cellular signal equipment your organization decides to deploy at the planning phase impacts its overall performance. The DAS Systems team of experts ensures to design and assemble a solution that adheres to your project needs in a cost-effective fashion.<\/p>\n<p>American Fire Wire&#8217;s novel addition to their product suite of coaxial cables and connectors, offers a cost-effective solution for project owners installing or retrofitting their DAS system. In order to provide greater flexibility during installation, the cable leverages braided technology and offers an improved bending radius. These Cables are able to successfully transport wireless signals inside of buildings and meet codes put forth by the National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) and the International Fire Code (IFC), when paired with the optimal consolidation of antennas and amplifiers. Consequently, organizations are able to rely on a more efficient and cost-effective solution for their operations. DAS Systems, Inc. foresees the need to revamp critical DAS capabilities due to today\u2019s maturing technological infrastructures.<\/p>\n<p>This business integration enables your organization to leverage:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extended Connectivity: Meeting 2-Hour Fire-Rated Survivability Requirements<\/li>\n<li>Deployment Ease: Eliminating Electrical setbacks due to structural schematics<\/li>\n<li>Cost Savings: Eliminating up to 50% of costs associated with wraps<\/li>\n<li>Complete Shielding: RFI\/EMI shield that minimizes system interference<\/li>\n<li>Mandated compliances: Meeting National Fire Protection Code NFPA 70 and 72<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>From an interoperability perspective, American Fire Wire is designed to synergistically match DAS Systems, ensuring connectivity when it matters most for first responders. As a result, organizations can rely on their DAS solution to properly address the requirements necessary for optimizing their ecosystems.<\/p>\n<p>Its turn-key solution enables DAS Systems to take your project from start to finish, while providing cross-integration with leading industry manufacturers, such as American Fire Wire.
