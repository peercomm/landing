Given the fact that modern construction materials and building systems nowadays can degrade or block both internal and external wireless communications; Public Safety DAS were established to outspread wireless coverage within buildings to allow efficient cell phones and radios operation, notwithstanding their location in the building.<\/p>\n<p>The need for Public Safety DAS are numerous, first most many US cities require many companies and building owners to have it installed in their buildings. Meeting key compliance regulations is one of the main needs.<br \/>\nAdditionally, consistent communication is extremely important for first responders.<br \/>\nIneffective communication disturbs first responders&#8217; jobs and becomes difficult and dangerous. When emergency situations occur, first responders are entirely reliant on location knowledge, voice communication, and video streaming. Due to the fact that too many buildings have zones with limited or no signal coverage such as garages, elevators, and tunnels, those areas trigger danger to first responders and the general public. With Public Safety DAS technology, workers, visitors, and clients can connect with emergency responders about their exact location while obtaining instructions, which gives them a better chance of being rescued securely.<br \/>\nBuilding owners should be fully responsible for their buildings &amp; should ensure that their buildings have broad signal coverage. Meeting minimum compliance standards is not enough; building owners should take responsibility by safeguarding that each individual in and around their property are operating in a safe setting.<\/p>\n<p>Building owners who work in conjunction to determine the right Public Safety communications system for their building will comply with rules and regulations, assist first responders during emergency situations and potentially save lives.
