For this specific reason, DAS systems are ideal for buildings with areas of poor cellular network coverage and they can bring loads of benefits to your business. In this blog, we will discuss some of the reasons and benefits of why you should invest in DAS.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>1. COST EFFECTIVENESS<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DAS uses several low-power antennas instead of one high-power antenna. This means your business will eventually be consuming less power, allowing you to save money over time with reduced energy bills and general cost of operation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>2. STRONGER SIGNAL &amp; CELLULAR COVERAGE<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A distributed antenna system covers all areas of a building, can alleviate poor cell signals and increase overall capacity to ensure consumers receive a pleasant in-building online experience. Installing a DAS system ensures everyone at the premises from staff, clients and visitors to enjoy better signal and the ability to make needed phone calls without having to move around to find spots with better services.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>3. IMPROVED EFFICIENCY<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A distributed antenna system provides enhanced communication and improved coverage for all of your business communications, including conference calls, large meetings, etc. With the installation of a DAS system, the possibilities of a call disconnecting mid-meeting will be drastically reduced.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. INDOOR &amp; OUTDOOR COVERAGE<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure an enhanced signal both inside and outside your property, you should install a distributed antenna system with <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">microwave radio equipment<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Connectivity and coverage are imperative or IoT to be effective. DAS can enhance reliable in-building communications for continuous connectivity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>5. AUGMENTED WI-FI CONNECTIVITY<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most buildings offer Wi-Fi, but many structures often experience bandwidth limitations when many users connect to their network.\u00a0 Wi-Fi, is an unlicensed spectrum, which means that there isn\u2019t any limit to the number of users trying to join to a limited, shared resource. Installation of a distributed antenna system adds coverage and capacity, which can\u00a0 offload the Wi-Fi burden. Obviously, DAS has a limited volume of bandwidth as well, but every allocated DAS user would have a devoted pipeline to the network, resulting in a better experience compared to Wi-Fi low connectivity due to overcapacity problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN INSTALLING A DISTRIBUTED ANTENNA SYSTEM?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At DAS Systems, we are experts in designing and installing distributed antenna systems that boost cellular signals in difficult to reach areas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact us today to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.peercom.org\/proposal\/\">get started<\/a>!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many businesses struggle with limited wireless coverage and mobile signals within their buildings.
